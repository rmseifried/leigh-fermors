# The Leigh Fermors' journey through Mani in 1951

This is a web map of Patrick (Paddy) and Joan Leigh Fermors' first trip through the Deep Mani (in the southern Peloponnese, Greece). For more information about the data and methodology, see the article "Mapping the Leigh Fermorsâ€™ Journey through the Deep Mani in 1951" (currently in review - link will be added when it is available).

**Leigh Fermors' route** - the most probably route that the couple followed from Limeni (in the northwest part of the Deep Mani) to Kotronas (in the northeast). They walked most of the route on foot, but also took a bus and a boat for sections of the journey.

**Least-cost paths** - for parts of the journey that the Leigh Fermors walked on foot, we used least-cost analysis (LCA) to model the potential route. Our methods generally forced the least-cost paths to stick to footpaths and roads, and picked routes that took the least amount of time to walk. As we discovered, these weren't always the routes that an actual traveler on foot would have taken.

**CARTography hikes** - these were the routes that we followed when we set out to recreate the Leigh Fermors' hikes ourselves. We generally followed the course of the least-cost paths, but opted to follow different routes in a few places.

**Modern roads** - OpenStreetMaps data curated by the [American School of Classical Studies at Athens](https://www.ascsa.edu.gr/excavations/ancient-corinth/digital-corinth/maps-gis-data-and-archaeological-data-for-corinth-and-greece).

**Premodern paths** - All the footpaths and stone-cobbled roads (Greek: *kalderimia*) that existed in the region before the mid-20th century. A shapefile of this dataset (along with a lot of other files related to least-cost analysis) can be downloaded from Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2233046.
